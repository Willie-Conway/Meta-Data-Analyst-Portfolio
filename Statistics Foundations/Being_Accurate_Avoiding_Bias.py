def survey_bias():
    """
    Survey Bias refers to errors in survey design or data collection that skew results.
    This can occur in several ways:
    
    1. **Order Bias**: The order of questions or answers can influence responses.
       - Example: Asking "How much do you love our product?" before "Have you used it?" may lead to biased responses.
       - Mitigation: Randomize the order of questions/answers.
    
    2. **Leading Questions**: Questions phrased in a way that suggests a desired answer.
       - Example: "Would you prefer this delightful product A or that disgusting product B?" 
       - Mitigation: Use neutral wording like "Which product do you prefer, A or B?"
    
    3. **Recall Bias**: Participants may inaccurately remember past events.
       - Example: Asking "How often did you buy from us last year?" may lead to inaccurate responses.
       - Mitigation: Ask specific, multiple-choice questions about recent purchases.
    """
    print("Survey Bias: Mitigation strategies include randomizing question order, avoiding leading questions, and using specific queries.")

def culture_bias():
    """
    Culture Bias occurs when surveys do not account for cultural differences.
    This can lead to misinterpretation of questions or results, especially in diverse populations.
    
    Example: A survey asking about "holiday shopping" may not resonate in cultures with different holiday customs.
    
    Strategies to avoid Culture Bias:
    - Use local surveyors familiar with the culture.
    - Ensure translations are culturally relevant, not just literal.
    - Utilize localization experts to adapt surveys to different cultural contexts.
    """
    print("Culture Bias: Use local surveyors, ensure culturally relevant translations, and consult localization experts.")

def confirmation_bias():
    """
    Confirmation Bias is the tendency to favor information that confirms existing beliefs.
    This can affect how data is interpreted.
    
    Example: If an analyst believes a new marketing campaign is successful, they may focus on positive feedback while ignoring negative comments.
    
    To mitigate:
    - Maintain objectivity; do not approach surveys with a predetermined hypothesis.
    - Encourage open-mindedness and critical thinking when analyzing results.
    """
    print("Confirmation Bias: Stay objective, avoid predetermined hypotheses, and promote critical analysis.")

def observation_bias():
    """
    Observation Bias occurs when participants alter their behavior because they know they are being observed.
    
    Example: If participants know they are being recorded during a product test, they might overstate their satisfaction.
    
    To minimize this bias:
    - Create a comfortable environment for participants.
    - Allow for anonymity when sensitive questions are asked, which can help in collecting honest responses.
    """
    print("Observation Bias: Ensure a comfortable environment and allow anonymity for sensitive questions.")

def selection_bias():
    """
    Selection Bias arises when the sample does not accurately represent the target population.
    This can happen if certain groups are over- or under-represented in the sample.
    
    Example: Surveying only customers who purchased a premium product may exclude valuable insights from budget-conscious customers.
    
    To avoid Selection Bias:
    - Use random sampling techniques to ensure all groups are fairly represented.
    - Be aware of any factors that might lead to biased selection.
    """
    print("Selection Bias: Employ random sampling methods to ensure representation of the entire population.")
