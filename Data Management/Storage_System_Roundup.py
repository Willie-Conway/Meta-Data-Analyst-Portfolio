# Storage Systems Roundup

# Several common storage systems exist, and in this reading, we’ll review some of the types 
# or tools you’ll most often interact with.

# Relational Databases (SQL)
def relational_databases_overview():
    """
    Overview of Relational Databases.

    A relational database stores data in tables. These tables are like spreadsheets, 
    with columns and rows of data. Each column represents a specific category of 
    information, like "book title" or "author." Each row represents a unique entry, 
    like a specific book with its title, author, and publication date. This structured 
    format allows for efficient data organization and retrieval.

    Typical use cases include financial systems, inventory management, and customer 
    relationship management (CRM) systems.

    Pros:
    - Structure: Data is organized efficiently.
    - Relationships: Tables can be linked, allowing for data connections across categories.
    - Standardized language: SQL is widely used, making it transferable across different 
      database systems.

    Cons:
    - Scalability: Not the best for storing massive amounts of unstructured data.
    - Complexity: Excessive relationships can significantly increase complexity.

# MongoDB (Document or NoSQL Database)
def mongodb_overview():
    """
    Overview of MongoDB - a NoSQL database.

    MongoDB is a commonly used NoSQL database known for its ease of use and rich query 
    capabilities. It excels when dealing with semi-structured or unstructured data that 
    evolves rapidly. Its flexible, schema-less nature makes it ideal for situations 
    where the data model is still developing or changes frequently. It's a great choice 
    for content management systems, mobile applications, and real-time analytics, where 
    speed and scalability are key.

    Pros:
    - Schema-less: Documents can have varying structures.
    - Rich querying: Supports complex queries that search, filter, and aggregate data.
    - Horizontal scaling: Scales horizontally by adding more servers to the cluster.

    Cons:
    - Performance: May not be ideal for complex queries on large datasets.
    - Data consistency: May require additional configuration to ensure strong data 
      consistency.

# Cassandra (Wide-Column Store)
def cassandra_overview():
    """
    Overview of Cassandra - a wide-column store database.

    If you need to handle massive amounts of data with high availability and fault tolerance, 
    Cassandra is your go-to. Cassandra is a distributed database designed to be highly 
    available and scalable. Typical use cases include time-series data, Internet of Things 
    (IoT) applications, and any system where you need to ingest and store vast amounts of 
    data quickly and reliably.

    Pros:
    - High availability: Ensures continuous operation even during server failures by 
      replicating data across multiple copies.
    - Scalability: Excels at working with massive datasets and many writes to the database 
      simultaneously.
    - Flexible partitioning: Allows data to be partitioned based on specific criteria.

    Cons:
    - Complexity: Complexity makes setting up and managing a distributed database more 
      challenging.
    - Limited querying: Querying capabilities may not be as advanced as MongoDB for some cases.

# Amazon Redshift (Data Warehouse)
def amazon_redshift_overview():
    """
    Overview of Amazon Redshift - a fully managed data warehouse service.

    Amazon Redshift is a fully managed data warehouse service provided by Amazon Web Services 
    (AWS). It's known for its cost-effectiveness and ease of use. Columnar storage and 
    massively parallel processing (MPP) architecture are optimized for fast query performance. 
    Redshift is commonly used for business intelligence (BI) dashboards, data science, and 
    ad hoc analysis, where insights are derived from historical data.

    Pros:
    - Centralizing data: Bringing information from various sources together.
    - Transforming data: Cleaning, organizing, standardizing, and structuring data for analysis.
    - Historical data storage: Analysts can track changes and identify trends by maintaining 
      a historical data record.

    Cons:
    - Cost: Cost can be prohibitive.
    - Complexity: Data transformation and integration can require skilled personnel and 
      potentially lengthy setup times.
    - Security: Storing sensitive data in a centralized location necessitates robust security 
      measures.
