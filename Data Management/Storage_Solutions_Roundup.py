# Communication Protocols

    Communication Protocols define rules for data exchange over a network.

    - SSL (Secure Socket Layer): Establishes a secure connection, encrypting transmitted data

    Key features of SSL:
        - Encryption: Prevents unauthorized access during data transmission.
        - Authentication: Ensures clients communicate with the intended server.
        - Widespread adoption: Foundation for subsequent protocols like TLS.
    
    - TLS (Transport Layer Security): The successor to SSL with enhanced security.
    
    Benefits of TLS over SSL:
        - Enhanced security addressing SSL vulnerabilities.
        - Strong encryption resistant to decryption.
        - Backward-compatible with SSL.
    
    Challenges of TLS:
        - Trust model: Relies on digital certificates issued by CAs, which can be vulnerable.
        - Compatibility: May not be fully compatible across different platforms.
        - Performance overhead: Adds computational overhead, impacting network performance.
