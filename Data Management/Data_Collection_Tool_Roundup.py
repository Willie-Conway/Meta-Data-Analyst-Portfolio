# Scrapy
def scrappy_overview():
    """
    Overview of Scrapy - a web scraping framework.

    Scrapy is a powerful and versatile open-source framework for extracting data from websites.
    It provides a structured approach to building web crawlers that navigate websites, follow
    links, and extract information based on your defined rules.

    Written in Python, Scrapy offers a high degree of customization and extensibility, making
    it suitable for projects of varying complexity.

    Pros:
    - Scalability: Designed to handle large-scale projects with efficiency.
    - Customization: Highly customizable and extensible to fit specific needs.
    - Community & Documentation: Extensive documentation and a large user community for support.
    - Performance: Fast and efficient due to its asynchronous architecture.

    Cons:
    - Learning curve: Requires knowledge of Python and web scraping concepts.
    - Overkill for simple tasks: Might be too complex for basic scraping needs.
    - Dynamic content challenges: Primarily for static websites; it can be trickier with 
      JavaScript-heavy pages.

    Overview of SurveyMonkey - a survey service.

    One of the most recognized survey services is SurveyMonkey, which offers various features,
    including question types, custom branding, and built-in reporting tools to help analyze the results.

    While there is a free option, some more advanced options, like targeting specific demographics
    in the audience panel, are locked behind the paid options.

    Pros:
    - User-friendly: Intuitive interface, easy to create and customize surveys.
    - Question variety: A wide range of question types and response options.
    - Analysis tools: Built-in tools for data analysis and reporting.
    - Audience Panel (Paid): Access to a diverse audience for targeted surveys.

    Cons:
    - Limited Free Features: Some advanced features are only available in paid plans.
    - Cost: Paid plans can be expensive, especially for large-scale surveys.
    - Data Limitations: Restrictions on data exports and analysis in free plans.

# Adafruit IO
def adafruit_io_overview():
    """
    Overview of Adafruit IO - a sensor data collection program.

    Adafruit IO is a program designed to collect and aggregate sensor data, enabling streamlined
    analysis and interpretation of many types of inputs.

    Adafruit IO is easy to set up, even for beginners, and Adafruitâ€™s data visualization and
    seamless compatibility make getting started relatively simple.

    It has limited scalability, though, and works best with Adafruit's hardware, but it can still be a helpful option.

    Pros:
    - Beginner-friendly: Simple setup and easy-to-use interface.
    - Data visualization: Built-in tools for visualizing data from connected devices.
    - Adafruit ecosystem: Seamless integration with Adafruit's hardware and software.
    - Free tier: Offers a free plan with basic features for smaller projects.

    Cons:
    - Limited scalability: Not ideal for large-scale or complex IoT (Internet of Things) projects.
    - Hardware bias: Works best with Adafruit hardware but may have limitations with other brands.
    - Advanced features: More sophisticated features require a paid subscription.
